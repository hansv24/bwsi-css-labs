The reason I board is because I play soccer for an MLS NEXT team there. I'm into math, CAD, and 3D printing, and in my free time I like to read mysteries, play Brawl Stars, and eat ice cream. After watching the Olympics, I'm also thinking of getting into competitive curling and am in the process of searching for potential partners (so let me know if you're interested). Looking forward to working with you!")
